	<h1>Serve Human Foundation</h1>
	<p>"STUDY BE ENJOYABLE Through the Great war of Liberation in 1971 we got our beloved independent Bangladesh. Such a victory was possible because of our Father of the Nation National Leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He is the Architect of our Independence and the Greatest Bangali in a Thousand Years. We had to make many sacrifices. After independence, we have noticed domestic and foreign malpractices to push this country backwards. But no conspiracy or evil force could push us too far back. We have seen that Bangladesh has progressed in these fifty years of independence. The present government is moving Bangladesh forward at a tremendous speed with great success. This trend of Development continues despite hundreds of limitations. However, there is no alternative to the unity of people of all classes and professions in the country to take Bangladesh to greater heights of prosperity. Therefore, the Serve Human Foundation has been playing a unique role in making the Young generation of this country efficient and capable. Serve Human Foundation is basically a charitable, voluntary, non-political and non-profitable organization. Formed with the slogan "Study be enjoyable", the organization has been conducting their various activities for a long time. In 2020, it has conducted various workshops and awareness programs. The activities of this organization have not stopped even after the Lockdown of the Global Epidemic Covid-19 from March 2020. Online training on skill development of young people in various fields was one of the important activities of this organization. Also during the Corona Lockdown, the workers of</br></br></br></br></br> this organization in different districts of Bangladesh were always by the side of the endangered people with the help of relief. In this New Year, we have various Skills development training programs for the young society of the country. We expect the humble cooperation of all to make all these programs successful and fruitful. We hope you will all be by our side. Today, in this Pandemic, we all pledge that we will fulfill our responsibilities properly and sincerely. Only then can we take our beloved Bangladesh to the pinnacle of prosperity in a very short time. We look forward to your continued support in helping our dream." -Mohsinul Haque(President and CEO)
